# Task Management App

## Description
The **Task Management App** is a web application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this application allows users to add, edit, delete, and filter tasks, as well as track their completion status. The app also features drag-and-drop functionality for easy task organization.

### Key Features:
- **Add Tasks**: Users can input new tasks and add them to their task list.
- **Edit Tasks**: Users can modify existing tasks to update their descriptions.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks from their list with a confirmation prompt.
- **Toggle Completion**: Users can mark tasks as completed or incomplete using checkboxes.
- **Filter Tasks**: Users can filter tasks based on their completion status (all, completed, or incomplete).
- **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**: Users can rearrange tasks by dragging and dropping them in the desired order.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, allowing users to retain their task list even after refreshing the page.

### Code Structure:
- **HTML**: The structure includes an input field for adding tasks, a button to submit new tasks, a dropdown for filtering tasks, and a list to display the tasks.
- **CSS**: The styling provides a modern and clean interface with a dark theme, enhancing user experience.
- **JavaScript**: The script manages the application's logic, including task management functions (add, edit, delete, toggle completion), rendering tasks, and handling drag-and-drop functionality.

### Usage:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Add a new task in the input field and click "Add Task" to include it in your task list.
4. Edit or delete tasks as needed using the respective buttons.
5. Use the filter dropdown to view all tasks, completed tasks, or incomplete tasks.
